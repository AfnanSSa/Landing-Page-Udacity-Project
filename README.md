    - Navigation
        The project includes a dynamic navigation menu that is generated based on the sections of the webpage. Each navigation item corresponds to a section, facilitating seamless navigation throughout the page.

    - Dynamic Active Class
        As you scroll through the page, the active section is highlighted dynamically in the navigation menu. This provides visual feedback to users, indicating their current position on the page.

    - Scrolling Effect
        Smooth scrolling effects have been implemented when using the navigation menu to jump to specific sections. This enhances the user experience by providing a visually appealing transition between sections.
    
    - Scroll-To-Top Button
        This button becomes visible when users scroll below the fold of the page, providing a convenient mechanism to swiftly return to the top of the landing page.
